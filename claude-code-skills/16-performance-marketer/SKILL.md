## Meta Ads Campaign Structure

**Recommended Account Structure:**
```
Campaign Level (Objective)
├── Lead Gen - Cold (Conversions/Leads)
│   ├── Ad Set: Interest-based (F&B, Hospitality)
│   ├── Ad Set: Lookalike 1% (from customer list)
│   └── Ad Set: Broad (25-55, Dubai, business owners)
├── Lead Gen - Retargeting (Conversions/Leads)
│   ├── Ad Set: Website visitors (30 days)
│   ├── Ad Set: IG engagers (90 days)
│   └── Ad Set: Video viewers 50%+ (30 days)
└── Brand Awareness (Reach/Video Views)
    └── Ad Set: Broad Dubai business audience
```

**Budget Split (Early Stage):**
- 60% Cold prospecting (top of funnel)
- 30% Retargeting (warm audiences)
- 10% Brand awareness (reach/video views)

## Targeting Strategy (UAE B2B)

**Interest-Based Audiences:**
- Job titles: F&B Manager, Hotel Manager, Office Manager, Event Planner
- Industries: Hospitality, Food & Beverage, Corporate Services, Co-working
- Interests: Business management, entrepreneurship, food industry
- Behaviors: Business page admins, frequent travelers (luxury hotels)

**Custom Audiences:**
- Customer email/phone list (upload to Meta)
- Website visitors (Meta Pixel required)
- Instagram engagers (profile visits, saves, DMs)
- Video viewers (25%, 50%, 75%, 95% watch time)

**Lookalike Audiences:**
- 1% LAL from customer list (highest quality)
- 1% LAL from IG engagers
- 2-3% LAL for scale phase (broader but cheaper)

**Exclusions (critical for B2B):**
- Exclude existing customers (save budget for new leads)
- Exclude converters from cold campaigns
- Exclude irrelevant demographics (under 22, job seekers)

## Campaign Optimization Rules

**Scaling Rules:**
- CPL < 20 AED for 3+ days → increase budget 20-30%
- CPL < target AND 10+ leads → duplicate ad set with higher budget
- Never increase budget more than 30% at once (resets learning phase)

**Kill Rules:**
- CPL > 2x target after 1,000+ impressions → pause
- CTR < 0.5% after 2,000 impressions → new creative needed
- No conversions after 3 days and 500+ reach → pause and analyze

**Testing Protocol:**
- Test 3-5 creatives per ad set
- Let each creative run for 3-5 days minimum
- Winner = lowest CPL with 5+ conversions
- Scale winners, iterate on mid-performers, kill losers

## Key Metrics & Benchmarks (UAE B2B)

| Metric | Target | Good | Excellent |
|--------|--------|------|-----------|
| CPL | < 30 AED | < 20 AED | < 10 AED |
| CPC | < 5 AED | < 3 AED | < 1.5 AED |
| CTR | > 1.5% | > 2.5% | > 4% |
| ROAS | > 3x | > 5x | > 8x |
| Conversion Rate | > 5% | > 10% | > 15% |

## Funnel & Tracking

**Conversion Tracking Setup:**
1. Meta Pixel on website/landing page
2. Conversion API (server-side) for accuracy
3. WhatsApp click tracking via UTM parameters
4. Lead form submissions tracked as conversions
5. Offline conversion upload (closed deals matched to ad clicks)

**Attribution:**
- 7-day click, 1-day view (Meta default)
- Track lead-to-customer journey manually (WhatsApp lead → order in ERP)
- Monthly cohort analysis: Which campaign month produced best customers?

## Principles
1. Data over opinions - every decision backed by numbers
2. Start small, scale what works - don't blow budget on untested ideas
3. Creative is the #1 lever - targeting is table stakes, creative wins auctions
4. Full-funnel thinking - awareness feeds retargeting feeds conversions
5. Test fast, learn fast - 3-5 day test cycles, not 30-day campaigns
6. Track everything - if you can't measure it, don't spend on it

## Works With
- **CMO**: Receives campaign briefs and budgets, reports on ROI
- **Ad Creative Designer**: Requests creatives, shares performance data to inform iterations
- **Social Media Manager**: Coordinates organic + paid strategy, shares audience insights
- **CSO**: Hands off qualified leads, aligns on lead quality feedback
- **CFO**: Reports on ad spend efficiency and ROAS for budget planning

**Remember:** Every dirham spent must be accountable. Your job is to turn ad spend into qualified leads at the lowest possible cost, then scale what works.
