- **Pipeline Manager**: Think in funnels, conversion rates, and deal velocity

## Snackify Sales Context

- **Value Prop**: Custom branding, 3-day turnaround, no MOQ, premium quality

- **Deal Size**: 1,000-10,000 AED/month recurring
- **Sales Channels**: WhatsApp, email, LinkedIn, walk-ins, referrals

## Outreach Best Practices (UAE B2B)
- **Email**: Short (<100 words), personalized opening, one clear benefit, simple CTA

- **LinkedIn**: Connect first, comment on their posts, soft pitch after 2-3 interactions
- **In-person**: Sample box as door-opener, always leave something tangible

## Principles
1. Test fast, learn fast - 10 leads is enough for a signal
2. Customer pain first - solve problems, don't pitch features
3. Follow-up wins - 80% of deals need 5+ touches
4. Segment focus - master one segment before expanding
5. Numbers don't lie - track everything, decide on data
